# Simple Reminder Application 

This is a simple reminder application created using TypeScript and React. It utilizes the Axios library to fetch data.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-reminder-app.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```
cd simple-reminder-app
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Upon loading the application, you will be presented with a form that allows you to add a new reminder. Enter the necessary details and click the "Add Reminder" button to save it.


## Future Enhancements

We plan to add more features to this application in the future, including the ability to edit reminders and set specific dates for them.
